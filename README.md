----

Superkube is developed with design system in mind and contains system elements: the organization of variables, tokens, symbols, modules, etc. 
Look at the [Design System Starter Kit](https://imperavi.com/superkube/design-system-starter-kit/), which shows the logic of the framework.

At the same time, the framework has the usual declarative modifiers, which are found in other popular Frontend frameworks. In general, it is a hybrid framework, which combines all the best.

## How Superkube Works

Superkube is added as basic SCSS to your project and on its base you can create the kind of project you need. Superkube helps you build logic, use ready-made built-in modules and tools to increase speed and reliability of the result.

1. **Get** a copy of Superkube to your project.
2. **Create** your own variables based on Superkube and your modules depending on the project needs.
3. **Build** Superkube, your variables and modules then release the website CSS for production.

## Features

Superkube has many features and surprising uses. This is what is on the surface:

1. **Compactness**. Superkube is 3x smaller than similar frameworks. Only about 53kb.
2. **Systemic**. Built with design system in mind.
3. **Modularity**. Ideologically Superkube implies modular and reusable HTML and CSS code.
4. **Grid CSS**. Inside Superkube are flexible and reliable grid building tools.
5. **Dark mode**. It has built-in mechanisms for building a dark theme.
